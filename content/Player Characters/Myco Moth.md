Myco Moth is an eladrin bard and member of [[Eternus Victoria]].

## Description
#### Appearance
(Autumn) Myco has sunglow yellow skin that is freckled and tinted with oranges and soft reds. She has pink eyes that go with her hair. Her hair has a mixture of other fiery colours within it and is styled in a long thick plait with a big fringe that swoops to the right of her face. Myco is quite lean and fit from working in the circus but has many scars from sword tricks gone wrong, most of these are scattered on her arms and torso. Although there is a prominent scar going from the top of her eyebrow down and through her lip to her chin on the left of her face.

#### Personality
Growing up in the circus she has learned to put up a boastful performative persona. On stage, she is mischievous and playful. Behind curtains, she is similar but more mellowed although she still likes to poke fun. She also loves playing with kids and making sure they have a fun time at the carnival.

## Biography
#### Background
Myco was born in the [[Feywild]] as part of the Court of Moths. She grew up with Arna in the Moth Circus, before it joined with the Witchlight Carnival and she met all of her more current friends. Years ago, she came back from a training session with a huge gash down her face. Luckily she was found on the outskirts of the carnival before she bled out. Rumour has it that it was just a knife-throwing mishap, but that scar looks far too vicious...
