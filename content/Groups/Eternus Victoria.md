Eternus Victoria is an adventuring party based in Chimaera.

## Founding
Eternus Victoria was brought together under the collective goal of rescuing their friends from the hags of [[Prismeer]]. They met at the [[Witchlight Carnival]], where [[Arna Moth]] coerced them to join an arena battle. While the party was fighting, their friends were kidnapped and taken to Prismeer, forcing the party to search through the carnival and [[Feywild]] to find them.
